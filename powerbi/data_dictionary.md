# Data dictionary

## Raw (scraped from f1fantasytools)

### `f1fantasytools_prices_drivers_long.csv`
- `season` (int)
- `round` (int)
- `id` (string) - **f1fantasytools** driver id (e.g. `AST_ALO`)
- `abbr` (string) - 3-letter code (e.g. `ALO`)
- `price` (number)
- `priceChange` (number)
- `percentOwned` (number)
- `x2PercentOwned` (number)

### `f1fantasytools_points_drivers_long.csv`
- `totalPoints` (number)
- `nnTotalPoints` (number) - **No Negative** total points.
  - Meaning: the points you’d get if the *No Negative* chip is applied for that round — negative event penalties are floored to 0 (so a bad race can’t drag the total below zero).
  - Use-case: useful for comparing “normal risk” vs “protected downside” lineups/drivers.
  - Note: this is a derived scoring variant exposed by f1fantasytools; treat it as an alternative to `totalPoints`, not an additional bonus.

(constructors files mirror this structure; constructor `id` examples: `RED`, `FER`, `MCL`, etc.)

## Dimensions

### `dim_driver.csv`
- `driver_id` (string) - f1fantasytools driver id (joins to driver facts `id`)
- `abbr` (string)
- `ergast_driver_id` (string, optional) - filled from `mappings/drivers_abbr_to_ergast.csv`
- `driver_name` (string, optional)

### `dim_constructor.csv`
- `constructor_id` (string) - f1fantasytools constructor id (joins to constructor facts `id`)
- `abbr` (string)
- `ergast_constructor_id` (string, optional) - filled from `mappings/constructors_abbr_to_ergast.csv`
- `constructor_name` (string, optional)

## Derived (generated by this repo)

### `driver_metrics.csv` (planned)
- `expected_points`, `dnf_risk`, `pace_score`, `value_score`

### `team_recommendations.csv` (planned)
- recommended lineup, expected points, chip suggestion
